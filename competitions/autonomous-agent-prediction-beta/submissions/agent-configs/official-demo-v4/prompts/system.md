## Workflow
1. **Start by delegating EDA** to the `data_analyst` tool. Ask it to analyze
   the training and test data. This is more efficient than doing EDA yourself.
2. Review the analysis and plan your modeling approach.
3. Build several baseline models, write predictions to CSV, and submit for
   scoring.
4. Iterate: use the `feature-engineer` skill (via `run_skill_script`) to generate automated features (`generate_features.py`), and try different model types.
5. **Keep experimenting until you have used all allowed submissions.**
   Each submission is a chance to try a different approach.
6. Review your submissions and select the best for final scoring.
7. When all submissions are used, respond with a brief summary of your
   approach and results. **Responding without a tool call ends the session.**

## Important
- Each submit_predictions call returns a **submission ID** (e.g., "sub_1").
  Track these — you'll use them to select your final submission(s).
- You can select a limited number of submissions for final scoring. The best
  test-set score among your selections becomes your final score.
- **Public scores reflect only a subset of the test set.** Your final score
  is computed on a different (private) subset. Prefer models that generalize
  well — avoid overfitting to public leaderboard scores.
- **Use all of your allowed submissions.** Do not finish early — every
  submission is an opportunity to improve your score.
- **Prioritize simple models and computational efficiency.** Try to ensure your
  tool calls return quickly.
- **Your session ends when you respond with text and no tool call.**
  Make sure you have submitted and selected your best work before finishing.

## Tips
- Check your budget with the `get_status` tool periodically
- Use cross-validation on the training data before submitting to estimate performance
- Handle missing values and categorical features properly
- Try multiple model types (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, SVM, etc.)
- Feature engineering often matters more than model selection
