# Tasks

## Current Goal

- Produce a valid first `submission.zip` quickly, then expand solved task
  coverage before the Kaggle-reported deadline of `2026-07-15 23:59:00`.

## Next Experiments

- Submit the validated color-map package manually if we want an immediate
  leaderboard anchor.
- Add more low-risk ONNX builders for same-shape tasks: pure color swaps,
  single-pixel/local-neighborhood rules, masks, and simple geometric flips.
- Investigate task001-style Kronecker expansion and other repeated-pattern
  transforms with fixed ONNX reshape/matmul/gather graphs.
- Search public NeuroGolf notebooks/discussions for accepted ONNX construction
  patterns and current leaderboard tactics before deeper implementation.
- If submitting, immediately inspect Kaggle's accepted/rejected message and
  record the exact result here.

## Done

- Initialized `competitions/neurogolf-2026/` from the Kaggle URL.
- Downloaded and unpacked the official task JSONs and `neurogolf_utils.py`.
- Verified via Kaggle CLI that the account has entered the competition
  (`userHasEntered=True`).
- Built `submissions/color-map-baseline/submission.zip` with four validated
  ONNX files at archive root: `task016.onnx`, `task276.onnx`, `task309.onnx`,
  and `task337.onnx`.
- Created and locally executed the tutorial notebook
  `notebooks/neurogolf-2026-competition-tutorial.ipynb`; it builds and validates
  the same four-task ONNX baseline and writes a reviewable `submission.zip`.
- Uploaded the tutorial notebook to Kaggle as private kernel version 1:
  https://www.kaggle.com/code/dalloliogm/neurogolf-2026-first-onnx-submission-tutorial
  Initial Kaggle status after upload: `KernelWorkerStatus.RUNNING`.

## Questions

- Is Kaggle's displayed deadline timezone UTC? The CLI reports
  `2026-07-15 23:59:00` without an explicit timezone.
- Should we use one of today's 5 submission slots on the small anchor package,
  or first add a few more obvious low-risk tasks?
